- In Kotlin, each mutable (`var`) property has default getter and setter functions automatically generated for it. The setter and getter functions are called when you assign a value or read the value of the property.
- For a read-only property (`val`), it differs slightly from a mutable property. Only the getter function is generated by default. This getter function is called when you read the value of a read-only property.
- Property delegation in Kotlin helps you to handoff the getter-setter responsibility to a different class.
- This class (called *delegate class*) provides getter and setter functions of the property and handles its changes.
- A delegate property is defined using the `by` clause and a delegate class instance:
- ```kotlin
  // Syntax for property delegation
  var <property-name> : <property-type> by <delegate-class>()
  ```
